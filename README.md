## Getting Started

### First-Time Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. Open a terminal, navigate to the folder where you want the repo, and run:  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bekk/labyrintenfinale-bekksparrow.git

    Verify Node and npm are installed:

    npm --version
    node --version

    If either command returns command not found, install them (e.g., via Homebrew). Ask a coach for help if needed.

Running the Backend

    Navigate into the backend folder:

cd backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the backend:

    npm run dev

    Backend will run on port 8080.

    Open a browser at http://localhost:8080/api/tips to verify the backend is running.

Running the Frontend

    Open a new terminal window and navigate to the root of the repo.

    Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the frontend:

    npm run dev

    Frontend will run on port 3000.

    Open a browser at http://localhost:3000 to verify the frontend is running.

    You can access the backend from the frontend at http://localhost:3000/api/tips because a proxy in the Vite config forwards /api requests to the backend.

Deploying to the World

The app is hosted on Heroku: https://bekksparrow-9ffe029a038a.herokuapp.com/

.

To deploy, just push to Git. Herokuâ€™s pipeline will handle the rest. For any changes on Heroku, contact one of the coaches.
